The Authority has established a collaborative Dynamic Purchasing System
(DPS) for Telephony Services. The DPS comprises a number of categories
(lots) for the provision of Traditional Telephony, Internet Protocol
(IP) Telephony and Enterprise Bundled Services. A key objective is to
offer a straightforward, flexible and suitable route to market for
Scottish public sector bodies. See section III.1.1) for details of
public sector organisations who can access the DPS. No form of volume
guarantee has been granted by the Authority. The Authority shall not be
bound to order any of the services referred to in the lot descriptions.
The DPS will be open to entrants throughout its life who meet the
minimum criteria.
